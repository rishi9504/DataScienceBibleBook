# Data Science Overview
## What is Data Science? 

Data science is the domain of study that deals with vast volumes of data using modern tools and technigues to find unseen patterns, derive meaningful information, and make business decisions. Data science uses complex machine learning algorithms to build predictive models. The data used for analysis can come from many different sources and be presented in various formats.

Data science is a "concept to unify statistics, data analysis, informatics, and their related methods in order to “understand and analyze actual phenomena with data. It uses techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics. statistics, computer science; information science, and domain knowledge.

## Data Science vs Data Analytics vs Al vs ML 

While data analysts and data sclentists both work with data, the main difference lies in what they do with it.


Data analysts examine large data sets to identify trends, develop charts, and create visual presentations to help businesses make more strategic decisions. 

The responsibility of data analysts can vary across industries and compinies, but fundamentally, data analysis utilize data to draw meaningful insights and solve problems. They analyze well-defined sets of data using an arsenal
of different tools to answer tangible business needs:
i.e 
1. why sales dropped in a certain quarter,
2. why 4 marketing campaign fared better in certain regions,
3. how internal attrition affects revenue, etc

Data scientists, on the other hand, design and construct new processes for data modeling and production using prototypes, algorithms; predictive models, and custom analysis.
Data scientists. on the other hand. are more focused on designing and constructing new processes for data modeling and production. Because they use a variety of techniques like data mining and machine learning to comb through data. 

## The industries that use and hire Data Scientists

There are a lot of industries that need the services of a data scientist, Some of them are just in from of your eyes and you even use their products. Some of them are using the data science for the prediction of the risks and forecasting and some of them use it for user satisfaction. Let’s quickly go through some of the industries where data science is used vastly:

**Retail** : Retailers need to correetly anticipate what their customers want and then provide those things. If they don’t do this, they will likely be left behind the competition, There are many ways retailers can use big data and analytics to keep their shoppers coming back for more. For instance, retailers can use big data and analytics to create hyper-personal and relevant shopping experiences thar make their customers highly satisfied and more prone to making purchase decisions.

**Healthcare** : Healthcare is a major field using data science, mainly to improve health and patient care. Data science is used to get physicians the most comprehensive information on their patient’s well-being and be able to
provide a mare actionable plan for their health.

**Media, Advertising, & Marketing** : In marketing, media, and advertising, data science is used to leverage social media and mobile content in order to understand real-time media content usage patterns from people that use that media. Employers in this industry like to hire data scientists who come from a marketing background.

**Manufaciuring** : The manufacturing industry is an overlooked industry for data science application, but they use data science to boost their production system and revenue, Manufacturing also depends on data science fo detect the number of products being manufactured.

**Tech startups** : Entering a tech startup as a data scientist means wearing many hats, Tech startups use data science as a way to enable faster growth and compete within the marketplace. There is risk involved ina startup, but being able to refer to numbers can greatly mitigate those risks and ensure the proper return on investment (ROI) so the company can grow.

There are multiple other place where the use of data science is being used heavily. I am sure you will find it along the way.

## Applications of Data Science


The role of Data Science Applications hasn't evolved overnight. Thanks to faster computing and cheaper storage, we can now predict outcomes in minutes, which could take several human hours to process. Below are some of the fields where we see the application of data science.

**Fraud and Risk Detection**

The earliest applications of data science were in Finance. Companies were fed up of bad debts and losses every year. However, they had a lot of data which use to get collected during the initial paperwork while sanctioning loans. They decided to bring in data scientists in order to rescue them from losses.

Over the years, banking companies learned to divide and conguer data via customer profiling, past expenditures, and other essential variables to analyze the probabilities of risk and default, Moreover, it also helped them to push their banking products hased on customer’s purchasing power.

**Healthcare**

Thie healtheare sector, especially, receives great benefits from data science applications.

* Medical Image Analysis : Procedures such as detecting tumors, artery stenosis, organ delineation employ various different methods and frameworks like MapReduce to find optimal parameters for tasks like lung rexture classification. It applies machine learning methods, support vector machines (SWM), content-based medical image indexing, and wavelet analysis for solid texture classification.

* Genetics & Genomics : Data Science applications also enable an advanced level of treatment personalization through research in genetics and genomics. The goal is to understand the impact of the DNA on our health and find individual biological connections between genetics, diseases, and drug response.
Data science techniques allow integration of different kinds of data with genomic data in the disease rescarch, which provides a deeper understanding of genetic Issues in reactions to particular drugs and diseases. As soon as we acquire reliable personal genome data, we will achieve a deeper understanding of the hunan DNA, The advanced genetic risk prediction will be a major step towards more individual care.


* Drug Development : The drug discovery process is highly complicated and involves many disciplines. The greatest ideas are often bounded by billions of testing. huge financial and time expenditure. On average, it takes twelve years to make an official submission.
Data science applications and machine learning algorithms simplify and shorten this process, adding a perspective to ¢ach step from the initial screening of drug compounds to the prediction of the success rate based on the biological factors.
Such algorithms can forecast how the compound will act in the body using advanced mathematical modeling and simulations instead of the “lab experiments". 
The idea behind the computational drug discovery is to create computer model simulations as a biologically relevant network simplifying the prediction of future outcomes with high accuracy.

* Virtual assistance for patients and customer support : Optimization of the clinical process builds upon the concept that for many cases it is not actually necessary for patients to visit doctors in person. A mobile application can give a more effective solution by bringing the doctor to the patient instead. 

## Internet Search
Now, this is probably the first thing that strikes vour mind when you think Data Science Applications. All these search engines make use of data science algorithms to deliver the best result for our searched query in a fraction of
seconds. Had there been no data science, Google wouldn't have been the ‘Google” we know today,
## Targeted Advertising
If vou thought Search would have been the biggest of all data science applications, here is a challenger — the entire digital marketing spectrum. Starting from the display banners on various websites to the digital billboards at the airports ~ almost all of them are decided by using data science algorithms.
This is the reason why digital ads have been able to get a lot bigher CTR (Call-Through Rate) than traditional advertisements. They can be targeted based on a user's past behavior.
## Data Science life-cycle
A data sclence life cycle is an iterative set of data science steps you take to deliver a project or analysis. Because
every-data science project and team are different, every specific data science life cycle is different. However, most
data science projects tend to flow through the same general life cycle of data science steps.

Some data science life cycles narrowly focus on just the data, modeling, and assessment steps. Others are more comprehensive and start with business understanding and end with deployment.
And the one we'll walk through is even more extensive to include operations. It also emphasizes agility more than other life cyeles. 
This life cycle has five steps:

**Problem Definition / Business understanding** : The first thing you have to do before you start collecting data and building & machine learning model is defining and understanding the problem vou're trying to solve. You need to be able to transform the business needs into data science questions and actionable steps. A good way to approach this is by engaging with the right people whose business to process you want to improve or optimize and asking the appropriate questions.

**Data Investigation and Cleaning** : The next step after problem understanding is to collect the right set of data. Data collection is essential, and it's practically challenging or (nearly impaossible) to build a good moedel without quality data or the mechanism to collect the data.

It's not enough to collect raw data-without processing it. Just like pure gold, raw data is handly stable and useless in its pure form. After collecting the appropriate dataset, you need to adequately clean and process the data before proceeding to the next step.

In an ideal world, you're more likely to collect unstructured, irrelevant and unfiltered data. If you proceed to build an ML model without data processing and cleaning, your analysis results will definitely not make any sense.
It's that simple: bad data produces terrible models, no matter how much you tune parameters or optimize your model’s hyperparameters.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** At this point, you have a wealth of data. You've been able to clean and process the data to be as organized as passible, it's time to deeply inspect all the data features, data properties, build confidence in the data, gain intuition about the data, conduct a sanity cheek, figure out how to handle each feature. This entire process is  referred te as exploratory data analysis (EDA) — one of the common words in data science.

**Minimal Viable Model** : The model build and evaluation phase is where you do the actual modelling of the data Tix fact, many data scientists believe that the “real magic happens" at this phase. The first thing you hive to do at this stage is to split the cleaned dataset from the previous step into train and test sets,
You should use the training set to build predictive models and evaluate your model's performance on the unseen data points’ (test set). ML problems are generally classified as cither supervised or unsupervised.

*Supervised learning* involves building a model that can accurately predict the target variable using a set of features known as predictors. While *unsupervised learning* is a self-learning approach where the model has to find all kinds of unknown patterns and relationships between all predictors.

**Deployment and Enhancements** : Once the stakeholders are pleased with your model’s results, the next step is to deploy the model. A machine learning model isn't built to reside on a local machine forever. It needs to generate value for organizations, and the only way to use the model to make practical, data-driven decisions is by delivering  it to end-users,
**Data Science Ops** : Just like machines need maintenance, machine learning models need to be maintained as well. The “deploy once and run forever" practice is bad because several factors could affect an ML model’s predictive power over time. The Covid-19 pandemic is one good example of an unpredictable event.
I'd expect that all organizations bave updated or are already planning to update all the ML models they built before the pandemic to capture the new customer patterns and behaviors exposed during the pandemic. Generally, every organization
should have a model upgrade steategy for constantly updating their data and retraining theie ML model — may be at 3, 6, or 9 months intervals. 

**Who is a Data Scientist?**

A data scientist is a professional who uses scientific methods, statistical analysis, and programming skills to extract insights and knowledge from data. A data scientist is responsible for collecting, <leaning, processing, and analyzing>
