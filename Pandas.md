The best place to learn Pandas is the [user guide](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html) itself. We will try to add some extra examples as needed for better understanding following the official user guide.

### Pandas

Pandas is a powerful data manipulation and analysis library for Python. It provides data structures and functions needed to work with structured data seamlessly. The two primary data structures in Pandas are:

**Series:**  A one-dimensional array-like object that can hold any data type, similar to a column in a spreadsheet.
**DataFrame:** A two-dimensional, size-mutable, and potentially heterogeneous tabular data structure with labeled axes (rows and columns), akin to a table or a spreadsheet.

Pandas makes it easy to handle data in a variety of formats, such as CSV, Excel, SQL databases, and more. It offers a range of functionalities including data cleaning, transformation, aggregation, and visualization.

### Series

A `Series` in Pandas is a one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data type, such as integers, floats, strings, or even Python objects. It can be thought of as a single column of data.

Hereâ€™s a quick overview of key features and how to work with a `Series`:

### Creation

You can create a `Series` using various methods:

1. **From a List or Array**:
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   
   data = [10, 20, 30, 40]
   series = pd.Series(data)
   ```

2. **From a Dictionary**:
   ```python
   data = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
   series = pd.Series(data)
   ```

3. **With an Index**:
   ```python
   data = [10, 20, 30]
   index = ['a', 'b', 'c']
   series = pd.Series(data, index=index)
   ```

### Key Attributes

- **`.index`**: Returns the index (labels) of the Series.
- **`.values`**: Returns the values of the Series as a NumPy array.
- **`.dtype`**: Returns the data type of the Series elements.
- **`.name`**: Gets or sets the name of the Series.

### Basic Operations

- **Accessing Elements**:
  ```python
  series[0]  # Access the first element
  series['a']  # Access the element with label 'a'
  ```

- **Slicing**:
  ```python
  series[1:3]  # Slice the Series
  ```

- **Mathematical Operations**:
  ```python
  series + 10  # Add 10 to each element
  ```

- **Methods**:
  - `.mean()`: Compute the mean of the Series.
  - `.sum()`: Compute the sum of the Series.
  - `.count()`: Count the number of non-NA/null entries.

### Example

```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a Series with data and custom index
data = [10, 20, 30]
index = ['a', 'b', 'c']
series = pd.Series(data, index=index)

print(series)
```

Output:
```
a    10
b    20
c    30
dtype: int64
```
In Pandas, vectorized operations and label alignment are key features that enhance the efficiency and flexibility of data manipulation. Here's how they work with the `Series` data structure:

### Vectorized Operations

Vectorized operations allow you to perform arithmetic operations on entire `Series` or DataFrame objects at once, rather than looping through elements. This is both more efficient and more readable.

**Examples:**

1. **Arithmetic Operations**:
   ```python
   import pandas as pd

   # Create two Series
   series1 = pd.Series([10, 20, 30])
   series2 = pd.Series([1, 2, 3])

   # Add the Series
   result = series1 + series2
   print(result)
   ```

   Output:
   ```
   0    11
   1    22
   2    33
   dtype: int64
   ```

2. **Statistical Operations**:
   ```python
   # Compute the mean
   mean_value = series1.mean()
   print(mean_value)
   ```

   Output:
   ```
   20.0
   ```

3. **Applying Functions**:
   ```python
   # Apply a function to each element
   squared = series1.apply(lambda x: x ** 2)
   print(squared)
   ```

   Output:
   ```
   0    100
   1    400
   2    900
   dtype: int64
   ```

### Label Alignment

Label alignment ensures that operations between `Series` objects align data based on their labels (index). This means that when performing operations on `Series` with different indexes, Pandas will align the data according to the index labels, automatically handling missing data with `NaN` values.

**Examples:**

1. **Aligning Series with Different Indexes**:
   ```python
   # Create two Series with different indexes
   series1 = pd.Series([10, 20, 30], index=['a', 'b', 'c'])
   series2 = pd.Series([1, 2], index=['b', 'd'])

   # Add the Series
   result = series1 + series2
   print(result)
   ```

   Output:
   ```
   a    NaN
   b    22.0
   c    NaN
   d    NaN
   dtype: float64
   ```

   In this example, only the label 'b' exists in both Series, so only that element is calculated (20 + 2). Other labels result in `NaN` because there is no corresponding data in one of the Series.

2. **Reindexing**:
   You can also manually align Series by reindexing:
   ```python
   # Reindex to match
   series1 = series1.reindex(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'])
   series2 = series2.reindex(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'])
   
   result = series1 + series2
   print(result)
   ```

   Output:
   ```
   a     NaN
   b    22.0
   c     NaN
   d     NaN
   dtype: float64
   ```


- **Vectorized Operations**: Efficiently perform operations on entire `Series` objects at once, without explicit loops.
- **Label Alignment**: Automatically aligns data based on index labels during operations, making it easier to work with data that may have mismatched indexes.

### Name attribute in series

The `name` attribute in a Pandas `Series` is used to get or set the name of the `Series` object. Naming a `Series` can be helpful for identification, especially when dealing with multiple `Series` or when using them in a `DataFrame`.

#### Getting and Setting the Name

- **Get the Name**:
  ```python
  import pandas as pd

  # Create a Series
  series = pd.Series([10, 20, 30], index=['a', 'b', 'c'])
  
  # Get the name of the Series
  print(series.name)  # Output: None
  ```

  By default, the `name` attribute is `None` if not explicitly set.

- **Set the Name**:
  ```python
  # Set the name of the Series
  series.name = 'my_series'
  print(series.name)  # Output: my_series
  ```

#### Using the Name in Context

Naming a `Series` is useful when combining multiple `Series` or when creating a `DataFrame`. The name of the `Series` becomes the column label in a `DataFrame` when it is used as one of the columns.

**Example:**

```python
import pandas as pd

# Create Series with names
series1 = pd.Series([10, 20, 30], index=['a', 'b', 'c'], name='first')
series2 = pd.Series([1, 2, 3], index=['a', 'b', 'c'], name='second')

# Combine into a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({'first': series1, 'second': series2})
print(df)
```

Output:
```
   first  second
a     10       1
b     20       2
c     30       3
```

In this example, the names of the `Series` (`'first'` and `'second'`) are used as column names in the resulting `DataFrame`.

A `DataFrame` in Pandas is a two-dimensional, size-mutable, and potentially heterogeneous tabular data structure. It is one of the most commonly used data structures in Pandas and is similar to a spreadsheet or SQL table, where data is organized in rows and columns.

### Key Features of DataFrame

- **Two-Dimensional**: Data is organized in rows and columns.
- **Labeled Axes**: Rows and columns are labeled, which allows for easy access to data.
- **Heterogeneous Data**: Different columns can hold different data types (e.g., integers, floats, strings).
- **Size-Mutable**: You can insert or delete rows and columns.

### Creating a DataFrame

There are multiple ways to create a `DataFrame` in Pandas:

1. **From a Dictionary of Lists**:
   ```python
   import pandas as pd

   data = {
       'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'],
       'Age': [25, 30, 35],
       'City': ['New York', 'Los Angeles', 'Chicago']
   }
   df = pd.DataFrame(data)
   print(df)
   ```

   Output:
   ```
        Name  Age         City
   0    Alice   25     New York
   1      Bob   30  Los Angeles
   2  Charlie   35     Chicago
   ```

2. **From a List of Dictionaries**:
   ```python
   data = [
       {'Name': 'Alice', 'Age': 25, 'City': 'New York'},
       {'Name': 'Bob', 'Age': 30, 'City': 'Los Angeles'},
       {'Name': 'Charlie', 'Age': 35, 'City': 'Chicago'}
   ]
   df = pd.DataFrame(data)
   print(df)
   ```

3. **From a NumPy Array**:
   ```python
   import numpy as np

   data = np.array([[25, 'New York'], [30, 'Los Angeles'], [35, 'Chicago']])
   df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['Age', 'City'])
   print(df)
   ```

4. **From another DataFrame**:
   ```python
   # Create a DataFrame by selecting specific columns from another DataFrame
   df2 = df[['Name', 'City']]
   print(df2)
   ```

### Accessing Data in a DataFrame

- **Selecting Columns**:
  ```python
  print(df['Name'])  # Returns a Series
  print(df[['Name', 'Age']])  # Returns a DataFrame with selected columns
  ```

- **Selecting Rows by Index**:
  ```python
  print(df.loc[0])  # Access by label-based index (returns a Series)
  print(df.iloc[0])  # Access by integer-based index (returns a Series)
  ```

- **Slicing**:
  ```python
  print(df[1:3])  # Selects rows 1 to 2 (exclusive of 3)
  ```

- **Boolean Indexing**:
  ```python
  print(df[df['Age'] > 30])  # Selects rows where the 'Age' column is greater than 30
  ```

### Common Operations on DataFrames

- **Adding a New Column**:
  ```python
  df['Country'] = ['USA', 'USA', 'USA']
  print(df)
  ```

- **Dropping a Column or Row**:
  ```python
  df = df.drop('Country', axis=1)  # Drop a column
  df = df.drop(0, axis=0)  # Drop a row by index
  ```

- **Summary Statistics**:
  ```python
  print(df.describe())  # Summary statistics for numerical columns
  ```

- **Sorting**:
  ```python
  df = df.sort_values(by='Age')  # Sort by 'Age' column
  print(df)
  ```

### Example

```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a DataFrame from a dictionary of lists
data = {
    'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'],
    'Age': [25, 30, 35],
    'City': ['New York', 'Los Angeles', 'Chicago']
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Display the DataFrame
print(df)

# Add a new column
df['Country'] = 'USA'

# Select rows where Age is greater than 30
print(df[df['Age'] > 30])
```

Output:
```
      Name  Age         City
0    Alice   25     New York
1      Bob   30  Los Angeles
2  Charlie   35     Chicago

      Name  Age     City Country
2  Charlie   35  Chicago     USA
```
